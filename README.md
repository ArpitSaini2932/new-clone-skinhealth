🩺 SkinHealth – AI-Based Skin Disease Detection System

SkinHealth is a full-stack AI-powered web application that detects common skin conditions from uploaded images using a deep learning model.

The system integrates a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and a PyTorch-trained MobileNetV2 model to provide real-time skin condition predictions.

This project was developed as an academic minor project to demonstrate practical AI integration in a healthcare-inspired application.
